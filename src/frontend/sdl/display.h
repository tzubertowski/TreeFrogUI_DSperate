  // line is still in L1. The rescale pass then disappears entirely, along
  // with the cold re-read of the framebuffer that dominated it, and the
  // present becomes a 1:1 copy.
  //
  // The destination has to be the buffer that is actually presented, or the
  // saving is spent again on a copy: scaling into a panel-sized texture still
  // leaves SDL_RenderCopy reading 3.6 MB and writing 3.6 MB, where the
  // framebuffer path's RenderCopy reads only 192 KB. So this mode drops
  // SDL_Renderer and renders into the window surface, which on Wayland is the
  // shm buffer SDL commits. That is also the shape the compositor-bypass path
  // needs, with a dma-heap allocation in place of the shm buffer; doing it
  // here first measures the scaling win on its own, on the path that ships.
  //
  // Renderer-based drawing (draw()) is unavailable while this is on.

  //  1. a scanout tier (scanout.h): CMA dma-heap buffers the display samples
  //     or scans out without a copy. Under Wayland that is DmabufOut, on
  //     SDL's Wayland surface; under KMSDRM it is DrmOut, page-flipped onto
  //     the panel's CRTC. DS_DMABUF=0 disables either, =1 requires it
  //     (fail loud).
  //  2. window surface: SDL's shm path under a compositor. On KMSDRM this is
  //     not a software path at all -- SDL has no window framebuffer there, so
  //     it is a hidden GLES renderer; see display_drm.h.
  // `grid`: whether the LCD grid applies to this view. A view scaled below
  // 2x has no room for a lit pixel beside a black seam: the seams the
  // fractional rule still lands there (one run in four at 1.25x) read as
  // noise, not a grid. So under the full grid the small screens -- the PiP
  // inset, the dominant layouts' secondary -- go plain unless a whole panel
  // cell (chunky, >= 4 px) carries the grid per cell. A dimmed grid is an

  // view would only darken, so none gets it. See grid_on().
  // `xrun_plain`: the nearest map before chunky rewrote it into pairs or
  // cells, for a page that wants the view's geometry without the effect.
