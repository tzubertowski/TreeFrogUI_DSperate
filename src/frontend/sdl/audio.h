// The device is opened at its own rate and the SPU's 32768 Hz stream is
// resampled here on the way in (linear, two taps: a 32.768 -> 48 kHz step on
// a DS mix is well inside what the DAC's own filtering hides). Resampling in
// the sound daemon instead measured ~1 ms a frame on the RG DS (PipeWire's
// clock is locked to 48 kHz there) -- `native_rate` false restores that, the
// device then being asked for 32768 Hz. Samples are queued rather than pulled
// from a callback: the SPU already buffers a ring, and queueing keeps the
// whole frontend single-threaded.
//
// The queue is also the clock. Emulating a frame produces a fixed 547-odd
// samples of audio, so holding the queue near a target depth paces the
// emulator at exactly the DS's frame rate without a timer.
